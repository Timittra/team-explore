# My Project Name ===> Team Explore


## About Project 

This project is all about **exploring FootBall teams** and their information. As I am a football lover I enjoyed most while doing the project. 
But it was interesting for me. I have used React Router through out the project. Using **API** I have loaded data and show various information as it can be more user friendly to show and to read. Also I have designed the ui using **bootstrap, React Bootstrap and Material UI**. In this project you will get more information about the teams using their **social media sites** which you will get in the detail page of one specific team. I have used **FontAwesome icons** for better interaction. I hope you will love it.
